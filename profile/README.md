Moonlight allows you to play your PC games on almost any device, whether you're in another room or miles away
from your gaming rig.

Moonlight (formerly Limelight) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol.
We implemented the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield and wrote a set of 3rd party clients.

You can stream your collection of PC games from your [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) PC to any
supported device and play them remotely. Moonlight is perfect for gaming on the go without sacrificing the graphics
and game selection available on PC.
